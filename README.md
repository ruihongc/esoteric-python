# esoteric-python
Encode any Python3 program in 9 unique characters

These 9 characters are: cex'=%() and the '\n' newline character.

Compared to other esoteric Python variants, this variant uses the fewest unique characters for Python3 and produces the smallest output files. Output file sizes are grow linearly with the input file size with a low coefficient. Execution time is also kept to the bare minimal with a fast startup time linear to program size. Actual program execution time is same as original and not affected at all. Main python code is encoded in 7 unique characters and stored in the 'x' variable. A decoder for this program written in 9 unique characters is bundled in the output file. Works for any ASCII-encoded python program and produces valid working python code.
